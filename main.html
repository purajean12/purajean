                        <p>In the context of Philippine law and cases, "Plagiarism is a concept more understood in academic circles as an offense against academic integrity anathema to the strict standards of originality of scholarly works which members of the academic community subscribe to.” The Supreme Court has also described Plagiarism as the "deliberate and knowing 
                            presentation of another person's original ideas or creative expressions as one's own".</p>

                        <p>The case where plagiarism is admitted shall be instituted. A retraction will be published in PMB, and the authors banned from publishing in PMB for a number of years. Further, in the most serious cases the Publisher will report the plagiarism to the guilty parties' employer, and/or professional organization. If the investigation rules against the accusation of plagiarism, a letter stating this ruling shall be provided to the accuser, the authors accused of plagiarism, the authors of the original work, and the copyright holder. In either case, these actions should constitute closure of the allegation of plagiarism. An allegation of plagiarism is a very serious accusation, and should never be made lightly. On the other hand, self-policing is a major strength of the scientific community, and plagiarism should always be reported when it is suspected to have occurred. PMB reserves the right to amend the above 
                            detailed procedures should the practice of plagiarism worryingly become less rare than it is today.</p>
